When doing sinlge instruction the contoler can sen out the signlas when it receives 
the fucntion bits to all components in the data path. When a new instruction is loaded
in we reset all signals and send the new ones. However when doing pipelining this needs 
to be changed, the controler then needs to change specific singals depending on where 
in the datapath a specific instruction is. How is this done?
